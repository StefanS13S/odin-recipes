    <p>I got this from a friend of mine when she made it at one of her picnics. It's so easy and delicious! I recently made it at our cook-out and everyone asked me how I made it.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 (.7 ounce) package Italian-style dressing mix</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps:</h2>

<ol>
    
    <li>Place the chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper and pound until thin. Remove breasts and place into a large resealable plastic bag.</li>
    <li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, and Italian-style seasoning. Pour mixture into the plastic bag containing the chicken.</li>
    <li>Seal the plastic bag and shake gently to ensure that all the chicken is in contact with the marinade. Refrigerate marinated chicken pieces overnight or up to two days.</li>
    <li>When ready to cook, preheat grill and lightly oil grate. Place chicken breasts on the grill and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes per side.</li>
</ol>
